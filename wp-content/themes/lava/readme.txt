TO DO LIST
___________

# Still need to work on the mobile version of the theme (i.e add hamburger menu, better spacing and flex properties to certain elements)

# Need to find a better testing environment for the theme, as IWP is outdated, buggy and not  user-friendly anymore

# Need to add the breadcrumbs to the navigation (to the right of the viewport)
